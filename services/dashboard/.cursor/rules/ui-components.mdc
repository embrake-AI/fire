# UI Design Philosophy

## Always Use Design System Components

Never write raw HTML elements when a solid-ui component exists. Use components from `~/components/ui/`:

- **Card** for any boxed content, sections, or clickable items
- **Badge** for status indicators, labels, tags
- **Button** for actions
- **Collapsible** for expandable/hideable content

To add new components: `echo "y" | npx solidui-cli@latest add <component-name>`

## Semantic Color System

Colors convey meaning. Use them consistently:

| Semantic State            | Color Family                     |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Critical / Active / Error | Red                              |
| Warning / In-Progress     | Amber                            |
| Success / Complete        | Emerald                          |
| Informational             | Blue                             |
| Secondary / Muted         | Neutral grays via `muted` tokens |

Apply colors consistently across backgrounds, borders, text, and icons within a semantic context.

## Extract and Reuse Components

When you find yourself repeating similar UI patterns:

1. **Extract into a component** with props for the varying parts
2. **Keep styling uniform** - differences should be in content and semantic colors, not arbitrary styling
3. **Use props for variants** rather than creating multiple similar components

Example: If you have "Active Items" and "Pending Items" sections with the same structure but different colors, create one `ItemSection` component with `variant` or color props.

## Composition Over Customization

- Prefer composing existing components over adding custom styles
- When custom styling is needed, use Tailwind classes via the `class` prop
- Use `cn()` from `~/lib/utils` for conditional class merging

## Visual Hierarchy

1. **Primary content** - Full color backgrounds, prominent borders, larger icons
2. **Secondary content** - Subtle backgrounds (50% opacity), softer borders
3. **Tertiary content** - Muted colors, collapsible by default, smaller text

## Interactive States

- All clickable elements need `cursor-pointer`
- Hover states should provide visual feedback (`hover:shadow-md`, `hover:bg-*/50`)
- Use `transition-all` or specific transitions for smooth state changes
- Links wrapping block content need `class="block"` for proper layout

## Spacing Consistency

- Use `space-y-*` utilities for vertical rhythm between items
- Section gaps: `space-y-8`
- Item gaps within sections: `space-y-5`
- Internal padding: `p-4` to `p-5`

## Icons

Use `lucide-solid` for all icons. Size conventions:

- Compact UI (badges, inline): `w-4 h-4`
- Standard (cards, headers): `w-5 h-5`
- Hero/empty states: `w-10 h-10`

## Empty States

Empty states should be:

- Centered in their container
- Include a relevant icon (consider subtle animation like `animate-pulse`)
- Have a clear heading and helpful description
- Feel intentional, not broken
